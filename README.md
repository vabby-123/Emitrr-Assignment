- **Interactive Language Exercises**: Engage in interactive exercises to improve vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

- **Quizzes**: Test your language skills with quizzes and receive instant feedback to track your progress.

- **Multiple Language Support**: Choose from a wide range of languages to learn and practice.

- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your learning journey with a user-friendly dashboard displaying scores and achievements.

- **Leaderboard**: Shows the ranking of users..

- **Responsive Design**: The web app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your local machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- **MongoDB**: Install and configure MongoDB as your database. You can download it from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/).

- **Text Editor or IDE**: You'll need a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for code changes. Popular options include [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

- **Git** (optional): If you prefer using Git for version control, make sure Git is installed. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Language Learning Web App on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-learning-web-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd language-learning-web-app
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Install server dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd language-learning-web-app
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and configure your environment variables, including MongoDB connection details.

     ```env
     
     MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
     
     ```

   - Return to the project root directory and install client dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm install
     ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:

   - Start the server (from the 'server' directory):

     ```bash
     nodemon server.js
     ```

   - Start the client (from the 'client' directory):

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   The web app should now be accessible by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `frontend/`: Contains the React.js frontend code.
- `backend/`: Contains the Node.js and Express.js backend code.
- `public/`: Public assets for the client.
- `SpringBoot-sample`: Sample directory, ignore this.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux (for state management), Bootstrap (for styling), Axios (for API requests).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (using Mongoose for data modeling), JWT (for authentication), Bcrypt (for password hashing).
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage.
- **File Upload**: Multer for handling file uploads.
- **Testing**: Jest and Supertest for unit testing.
- **Deployment**: Deployment platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel can be used for hosting the app.

Thank you for choosing the Language Learning Web App for your assignment. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me.


**Note**-I have also tried to implement SpringBoot but due to lack of time i have avoid that idea, so please ignore the SprinBoot module.
Also i can convert this into a react native or flutter mobile application so if you need any assistance regarding that.please do let me know.
